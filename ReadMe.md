# Getting and cleaning data final assignment
This repository contains the necessary script to generate the tidy data set required for the last assignment of the Getting and cleaning data course on Coursera.

The tidy data set can be found in the "tidydata.txt" file.

The data set is generated from raw data described at (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).

The "run_analysis.R" script transforms the data into the resulting tidy data set. 

The used transformations as well as the resulting data set are described in the "codebook.md" file
